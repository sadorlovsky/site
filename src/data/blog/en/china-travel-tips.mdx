Before my trip to China, I spent a lot of time researching. Here's what actually helped, tested firsthand.

### Internet Without VPN

The biggest surprise: **the Great Firewall doesn't apply to foreign SIMs**. I bought a roaming eSIM before the trip (data only, no phone number), and everything just worked — Google, YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp. No VPN hassle at all. 5G/4G coverage, though speeds weren't always great.

I used Trip.com (a Chinese service) for booking flights, hotels, and attraction tickets — and that's where I got my eSIM too.

A note on ChatGPT: it doesn't work in China due to geo-restrictions. Even with a foreign SIM — you'll need a VPN. This was annoying for me since I kept asking it dumb questions like "how do you eat hot pot properly" 😅

### Paying for Things

I was nervous about payments — heard stories about China being cash-only or only accepting UnionPay cards. Reality was much simpler.

**Visa/Mastercard works in more places than you'd think:**
- You can tap your card or Apple Pay at metro turnstiles
- McDonald's, Starbucks, and other international chains accept cards
- Airports and hotels — no problem
- DiDi (taxi app) lets you link your card directly

**But for everything else — you'll need Alipay or WeChat Pay.** Small shops, street food, local cafes, convenience stores — it's all QR codes. Cards don't exist in that world.

Good news: both apps work for foreigners. You can link your Visa/Mastercard and pay via QR codes everywhere. I'd recommend setting this up before you fly — upload your passport for verification, link your card. Takes a few minutes, and you'll have full app functionality from day one.

There are two ways to pay: scan the vendor's QR code, or show your own QR code (vendor scans it or you hold your phone screen up to their scanner). I never figured out what determines which method or what difference it makes, but both work the same.

One thing I wasn't sure about: whether a Chinese phone number is required. It's not. I registered with my regular number and had zero issues.

### Apps Worth Installing

**DiDi** is essentially Uber for China. Link your card, call a ride, done.

**Amap** for navigation. Great for routes. But fair warning — English search is terrible. You pretty much have to type place names in Chinese. No opening hours, no website links in listings. My workflow: find places in Google Maps, then switch to Amap to actually get there.

**Trip.com** for booking. Trains, flights, attractions — all in one place, all payable with your card.
