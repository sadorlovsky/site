## Find substring in file and make it uppercased

Finds matched substring captured to a group and makes it upercased with `\U` before that group `\1`.

```bash
gsed -i.bak -E 's/(<PATTERN_TO_MATCH>)/\U\1/g' /path/to/file
```

```bash
# Example: Convert all lowercase "example" words to uppercase
   gsed -i.bak -E 's/(example)/\U\1/g' /path/to/file
```

Default `sed` installed in macOS doesn't support `\U` so `gsed` used here. It can be installed via brew

```bash
brew install gnu-sed
```

## Change Git commit author information

This command uses `git-filter-repo` to change the author and committer information for all commits not made by a specific author.

It's particularly useful when you've accidentally committed and pushed using your global Git config with one set of author details, but the repository needed a different local Git config with project-specific author settings.

```bash
git filter-repo --force --commit-callback '
if commit.author_name != b"<OLD_AUTHOR_NAME>":
    new_name = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_NAME>"
    new_email = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_EMAIL>"
    commit.author_name = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_NAME>"
    commit.author_email = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_EMAIL>"
    commit.committer_name = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_NAME>"
    commit.committer_email = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_EMAIL>"
'
```

To use this, you'll need to install `git-filter-repo` first:

```bash
brew install git-filter-repo
```

**⚠️ Warning: This rewrites repository history, so use with caution on shared repositories!**

> ### 💡 Pro Tip
> 
> If you frequently work across different GitHub accounts or organizations, consider setting repository-specific Git configs to prevent this issue:
> 
> ```bash
> # Set local repo-specific author details
> git config user.name "Work Username"
> git config user.email "work-email@company.com"
>
> # Check your current git config
> git config user.name
> git config user.email
> ```
