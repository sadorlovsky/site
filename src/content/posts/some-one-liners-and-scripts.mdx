## Find substring in file and make it uppercased

Finds mathed substring captured to a group and makes it upercased with `\U` before that group `\1`.

```bash
gsed -i.bak -E 's/<REGEX>/\U\1/g' /path/to/file
```

Default `sed` installed in macOS doesn't support `\U` so `gsed` used here. It can be installed via brew

```bash
brew install gnu-sed
```

## Change Git commit author information

This command uses `git-filter-repo` to change the author and committer information for all commits not made by a specific author. It's useful when you need to update authorship information throughout a repository's history.

```bash
git filter-repo --force --commit-callback '
if commit.author_name != b"<OLD_AUTHOR_NAME>":
    new_name = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_NAME>"
    new_email = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_EMAIL>"
    commit.author_name = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_NAME>"
    commit.author_email = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_EMAIL>"
    commit.committer_name = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_NAME>"
    commit.committer_email = b"<NEW_AUTHOR_EMAIL>"
'
```

To use this, you'll need to install `git-filter-repo` first:

```bash
brew install git-filter-repo
```

Note: This rewrites repository history, so use with caution on shared repositories!
